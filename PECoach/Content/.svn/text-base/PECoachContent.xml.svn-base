		<asset key="kAboutText">Welcome to the Prolonged Exposure (PE) mobile application (app).
			
		This app is designed to be used during treatment with a PE trained behavioral health professional.  By itself this mobile app is not sufficient to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
		
		You will use the convenient tools in this app during and after each PE treatment session.  The app will guide you through the homework that the therapist assigns to you and allow you to track and record your work and progress in treatment.
		
		The appointments and reminders feature will help you track your upcoming therapy sessions. Your therapist will audio record each of your sessions and the recountings of your traumatic memory for you to review later.  This app allows you to record your sessions directly onto your phone.

				How does exposure work? 

				Immediately following a traumatic event, most people have reactions including nervousness and anxiety, sleep problems, and being upset by reminders of the event.  For some people, these symptoms naturally decrease over time.  But for others, these symptoms continue to be a problem and they develop posttraumatic stress disorder.  Two factors maintain the PTSD symptoms: avoidance and unhelpful thoughts and beliefs.

            There are two kinds of avoidance: avoiding thinking about the trauma and avoiding situations that remind the person of the trauma.  People avoid in order to reduce their anxiety and distress about the trauma.

				The problem is that avoidance works in the short run to reduce distress and anxiety.  But in the long run it actually make the problems worse because it interferes with recovery.  Exposure works to help you recover by confronting the situations that distress you in a safe way.  We want you to learn two important lessons from exposure: 1) your distress and anxiety will decrease if you stay with the thoughts or in the situation long enough and 2) the negative things you think will happen during exposure actually don't happen.

				This treatment, Prolonged Exposure, uses two forms of exposure.  The first is called imaginal exposure, and involves revisiting the traumatic memory and recounting it aloud.  The second is called in vivo exposure, and involves confronting the objectively safe activities that you have been avoiding because of the trauma in a gradual manner, beginning with the easier ones and progressing towards more difficult ones.

				Exposure works in several ways.  First, revisiting and recounting your traumatic memories in imagination help you emotionally work through the traumatic event and think about what happened and about your behavior differently.  Second, exposure helps you learn that memories cannot actually harm you, and that feeling upset or anxious is not dangerous.    Third, exposure helps you learn that you CAN handle feelings of anxiety and distress, causing you to gain confidence in your ability to handle stress.  Fourth, exposure helps you learn that the more you approach difficult but relatively safe activities, the more feelings of anxiety and distress are reduced.  In other words, the more you do it, the easier it gets!  We call this habituation.

				Habituation means that by approaching situations and objects that cause you to be upset again and again and by sticking it out these situations no longer make you upset. This is because you learn that nothing bad happens to you while being in these situations. No one is hurting you and you are able to cope with your emotions. It is similar to getting back on a bicycle after falling off.  If you refuse to try again, over time you become more and more frightened of riding bicycles.  But if you force yourself to ride them despite your fear, you become less afraid.

				Habituation works with upsetting memories too.  Allowing yourself to think about the traumatic memories rather than avoiding them will help you to remember the trauma with less distress.  It will also allow you to gain control over those memories so that they are less likely to pop up at times you don't want them to.  The flashbacks, nightmares and intrusive thoughts that many trauma survivors often experience are less likely to occur after you repeatedly revisit the memory of the trauma.  And when they do occur, they are less upsetting. 

				Treatment with imaginal and in vivo exposure may seem difficult at first.  But with time you will find that this treatment becomes easier and will make you feel better about yourself in many ways.

		<asset key="kLearnBreathingRetrainingText">When people get upset, it's normal to breathe fast or even hyperventilate because being upset makes people feel like they need more air. The problem is that breathing fast doesn't actually have a calming effect. In fact, it usually makes people feel more anxious. If you took short, quick breaths right now, you would probably feel your heart rate going up and you might even start to feel anxious. This fast breathing produces bodily reactions that are similar to those of fear and anxiety. Therefore, breathing faster can make you more upset. Instead, when feeling upset or anxious it is better to actually breathe slower because slow breath can reduce feelings of stress or tension. Most people have some awareness of how breathing affects the way you feel. For example, when you are upset, someone might tell you to calm down and take a deep breath. However, deep breathing does not actually help calm down while slow breathing does. Therefore, it is important to pause between the exhale and the following inhale. To calm down or relax, you need to take normal breaths and slow your exhale, pausing in between. It's the exhale and pause that are important to relaxing, not inhaling.</asset>

		<asset key="kWatchBreathingRetrainingText">What you are going to do now is just take a normal breath in through your nose and then exhale. Your inhale will be normal; it's the exhale that you are going to slow down. With the exhale, some people like to think the word relax in their head, or another calming word, but for our practice we are simply going to count out the exhale. When you practice this, you might want to think a calming word in your head and extend the word for the length of the count. After the exhale, you will pause for 3 to 4 counts before inhaling again. Let's practice this. First, take a normal breath in your nose; now exhale through your mouth, lengthen your exhale and count in your head for ...1...2...3...4. Pause, and count in your head 1...2...3...4. Again, now inhale normally. Exhale and 1...2...3...4. Pause...2...3...4. Inhale, exhale...2...3...4, pause...2...3...4. Under the Practice tab, you are going to see a visual that reminds you of when to inhale and how long to exhale and pause. If this visual is either too fast or slow for you, you can control that by moving the - and + signs at the bottom of the screen. It won't slow it down or speed it up too much because we want you to get use to doing this within a certain range. The practice will last for 10 minutes; you should do this 3 times a day.</asset>

		<asset key="kTraumaReactionsViewAllText">People differ in how they react to a traumatic experience but certain reactions are common. Remember that after a trauma, it is natural to feel upset and stressful. But it's when the stress symptoms don't fade over time and when they interfere with everyday life that the person has Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Immediately following a trauma, it's very normal to have severe reactions. Many people start to feel better within weeks or up to three months and others recover more slowly. But some don't recover without help. It is generally helpful to everyone, no matter what the recovery length, to become more aware of the changes that can happen after a trauma in order to recover. 

		The primary symptoms of PTSD are fear and anxiety. During a traumatic event, fear and anxiety are normal. But it is when this fear and anxiety don't go away, or come back, that problems start. When anxiety lasts long after the trauma it can change your view of the world, your sense of being safe, or even your feelings of being able to control your life. Things that remind you of the trauma can trigger anxiety and the feeling of danger, like certain places, times of day, certain smells, or any situation that reminds you of the trauma. Sometimes these feelings come out of the blue without any trigger. Life itself can start to feel dangerous; things that normally won't have bothered you before the trauma can stop you in your tracks and even immobilize you. Triggers or cues can cause anxiety, like certain places, times of day, certain smells or noises, or any situation that reminds you of the trauma. 

		One way to think about PTSD is that this past event is haunting the person now. The haunting nature of PTSD comes out in the re-experiencing symptoms. You often don't want to think about the trauma but it can keep coming to mind anyway. Re- experiencing the trauma can happen through very vivid images that are called flashbacks, nightmares, or unwanted thoughts. These unwanted images or thoughts are your body's way of trying to digest what happened, since it was so shocking. And because you try not to think about these things, they will keep coming back. This is your brain's way of telling you that you need to stop avoiding the thoughts so you can "think through" and organize this experience in order to feel better. 

            Avoiding these thoughts is a very common way to try and manage trauma-related pain. The most common form of avoidance is trying to avoid situations that remind you of the trauma. Even situations that are less directly related to the trauma might also be avoided. For example, if the trauma happened at in a crowded market you might avoid public places. It's also possible that some thoughts are so intense that you might want to just block them out altogether and you may not remember parts of the trauma. Another way to avoid thoughts of the trauma is by pushing away, not only thoughts, but also painful feelings: emotionally checking out. This can leave you feeling emotionally numb and not able to experience even positive emotions.  This is often very upsetting to your family.
            
When your body experiences anxiety, it sort of revs you up, like a car. Hitting the gas pedal to get the car moving is similar to seeing or hearing something that signals to your body to get moving. This bodily reaction is called fight-or-flight and leads to increased arousal. Your heart pounds and you may feel like you are having a panic attack.  It may be hard to breathe. The digestive system shuts down, and your palms might sweat. Adrenaline, like a car's gas, kicks the body into gear so that you can get out of a situation or protect yourself. It probably helped you act and maybe even survive during the event, but in PTSD, this reaction happens even when you aren't in danger. Things that remind you of the trauma or trigger the same reaction as the trauma cause your body to go into fight-or-flight, making you jumpy, jittery, shaky, and easily startled. You might hear a loud noise, and while before the trauma that might not have made you jump, after it, you may have a boost of adrenaline and your body is ready to fight or run away. This physical hyperarrousal makes it difficult to think as clearly. Your body is in survival mode and you may focus only on what you see as dangerous and can't concentrate on anything else or think as clearly. It can also make it difficult to calm down enough to sleep. It can also make you irritable and impatient, especially if you aren't sleeping well. While fight-or-flight is helpful to survival, the extra energy it shoots into our body isn't helpful in day-to-day life. It can make the world seem full of danger. Another reaction to danger is to freeze and this can also happen during a trauma. 

		As we said, irritability and anger are common reactions to trauma. This might be confusing when you feel angry with people you are close to and feel anger more often than you ever did. Not only might you become angry with others, you can become more easily angered in different situations, impatient when things take too long or traffic is slow. You might also be angry with yourself. Some people feel like they should be able to live life just like before the trauma. 

		Feelings of guilt or shame are very common following a traumatic event. Sometimes people blame themselves for things they did or didn't do to survive or to help others survive. You may feel ashamed because during the trauma you acted in a way you normally won't or guilty because you survived while others didn't. 

		Grief and depression are also common after a trauma. This can include feeling hopeless or despairing. You might cry more often or not at all. You might lose interest in people and activities you used to enjoy. You may feel that plans you made for the future no longer matter or that life isn't worth living. This can lead to wishing you were dead or make you do something, or want to do something, to hurt or kill yourself. Along with this, you might grieve the life that you once had or planned to have. If you are feeling this way, please touch this number to talk to someone and get help.

		Trauma also can change your view of the world and your own self-image in a negative way. You may tell yourself, "If I hadn't been weak or had not done that, this wouldn't have happened to me." You might feel more negative about yourself after the trauma. 

		It is also common to see others more negatively and feel that you can't trust anyone. If you used to think that the world was relatively predictable and safe, trauma can change that view. It can convince you that the world is dangerous and others aren't to be trusted. These negative thoughts can make you feel that you have completely changed because of the trauma and relationships might now be tense. If you feel you can't trust anyone and if it is hard to feel close to people, imtimacy – both emotional and physical - may also become very difficult. 

		This change can impact sexual relationships. Some people find it difficult to want to have sex or even be interested in it. This can be impacted by the change in trust but also because of the emotional numbing. Like mentioned earlier, if you are trying to not feel any negative feelings, this can interfere with your ability to feel anything positive. 

		Another way of numbing or trying to change the way you feel is through the use of alcohol or drugs. While there is nothing wrong with responsible drinking, if you are using it to change how you think or feel about the trauma, it can become a problem. While increased drinking or drug use can offer a temporary fix, it often further slows down your recovery and causes problems of its own.
            
Many reactions to trauma are connected to one another. For example, a flashback may make you feel out of control and cause fear and anxiety. Many people think that this common reaction to trauma means that they are "going crazy" or "losing it." These thoughts can make you even more anxious. One of the reasons to go over the common reactions to trauma is to point out that PTSD is more than just nightmares and flashbacks. It is also to inform you that as you become aware of the changes that have happened because of the trauma, and as you process these experiences during treatment, the symptoms should become less distressing as you understand more about what you might be experiencing.</asset>

This can lead to wishing you were dead or make you do something, or want to do something, to hurt or kill yourself. Along with this, you might grieve the life that you once had or planned to have. If you are feeling this way, please touch this number to talk to someone and get help.</asset>

		<asset key="kTraumaReactionsThoughtsText">Trauma also can change your view of the world and your own self-image in a negative way. You may tell yourself, "If I hadn't been weak or had not done that, this wouldn't have happened to me." You might feel more negative about yourself after the trauma.</asset>

		<asset key="kTraumaReactionsAlcoholText">Another way of numbing or trying to change the way you feel is through the use of alcohol or drugs. While there is nothing wrong with responsible drinking, if you are using it to change how you think or feel about the trauma, it can become a problem. While increased drinking or drug use can offer a temporary fix, it often further slows down your recovery and causes problems of its own.</asset>

		<asset key="kTraumaReactionsConclusionText">Many reactions to trauma are connected to one another. For example, a flashback may make you feel out of control and cause fear and anxiety. Many people think that this common reaction to trauma means that they are "going crazy" or "losing it." These thoughts can make you even more anxious. One of the reasons to go over the common reactions to trauma is to point out that PTSD is more than just nightmares and flashbacks. It is also to inform you that as you become aware of the changes that have happened because of the trauma, and as you process these experiences during treatment, the symptoms should become less distressing as you understand more about what you might be experiencing.</asset>
